# zipFileToDb
Download zip file and save content to DB

You need to have Postgresql database up and running with configuration mention in application.properties. 

To run this project just clone repo, then there is need that application will have access to C: folder so that it can create folder and put there zip file, and after that extract it to xml file.

After permission is granted on your windows or mac machine just run application and it will do all automatically. You will see in console output saying that "Save to DB done"

Then you can check your db tables for data.

Thanks.
